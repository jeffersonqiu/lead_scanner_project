# Lead Scanner Pro - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

Lead Scanner Pro is a cross-platform mobile application that enables users to scan business cards using their device camera, extract contact information through on-device OCR, and manage a local contact library with advanced features like tagging, searching, and bulk export capabilities.

**Problem Statement**: Professionals and business users struggle with efficiently digitizing and organizing business cards they receive. Manual data entry is time-consuming and error-prone, while existing solutions often require cloud services that compromise privacy.

**Target Users**: Business professionals, sales teams, event attendees, and anyone who regularly collects business cards and needs to maintain organized contact databases.

**Value Proposition**: Privacy-first, on-device processing with powerful local management features, eliminating the need for cloud services while providing enterprise-grade contact organization capabilities.

## Core Features

### 1. Camera Capture & Bounding Box Guidance
- **What it does**: High-performance camera interface with real-time bounding box overlays to guide users in capturing business cards
- **Why it's important**: Ensures optimal card positioning for accurate OCR results and provides visual feedback during capture
- **How it works**: Uses react-native-vision-camera with frame processors to detect text regions and display overlay rectangles

### 2. On-Device OCR Processing
- **What it does**: Extracts text from captured business card images using Google ML Kit Text Recognition v2
- **Why it's important**: Provides privacy by keeping all processing local, with fast results and no internet dependency
- **How it works**: Processes captured images through ML Kit's cross-platform API, extracting raw text with layout information

### 3. AI-Powered Field Parsing
- **What it does**: Converts raw OCR text into structured contact fields (name, company, title, phone, email, etc.)
- **Why it's important**: Automatically categorizes extracted text into meaningful contact information
- **How it works**: Sends OCR text blocks to OpenAI API for structured JSON parsing, with optional image parsing for enhanced accuracy

### 4. Local Contact Library Management
- **What it does**: Stores, organizes, and manages scanned contacts with advanced search, tagging, and sorting capabilities
- **Why it's important**: Provides a centralized, searchable database of all scanned contacts
- **How it works**: Uses local storage (MMKV/AsyncStorage) with CRUD operations, search indexing, and tag-based organization

### 5. Bulk Export & Native Integration
- **What it does**: Exports contacts in multiple formats (CSV, vCard) and syncs selected contacts to native device contacts
- **Why it's important**: Enables data portability and integration with existing contact management systems
- **How it works**: Generates vCard 4.0 files and CSV exports, with multi-select interface for native contact sync

## User Experience

### User Personas

**Primary Persona - Sales Professional Sarah**
- Collects 20-30 business cards per week at networking events
- Needs quick capture and organization for follow-up
- Values privacy and data control
- Requires bulk export for CRM integration

**Secondary Persona - Event Organizer Mike**
- Manages large contact databases from conferences
- Needs efficient tagging and categorization
- Requires reliable backup and export capabilities

### Key User Flows

**Card Scanning Flow**
1. Open app → Camera view with bounding box overlay
2. Position card within overlay → Capture image
3. OCR processing (2-3 seconds) → AI parsing
4. Review and edit extracted fields → Save to library
5. Add tags and notes → Complete

**Contact Management Flow**
1. Library view → Search/filter contacts
2. Select multiple contacts → Bulk operations
3. Export to CSV/vCard or sync to native contacts
4. Share via native sharing sheet

### UI/UX Considerations
